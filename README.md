### Outsourced Excel files were obtained, containing the count of visitors entering the UCSB recreation center per hour. The data was sorted and filtered meticulously to ensure accuracy and then stored in a proper CSV file. Using Pandas, I performed data cleaning by applying filters specific to certain parts of the academic quarter.

###To present the data in an easily understandable format, I created visualizations using Matplotlib and Canva. These visual representations were designed to convey the insights effectively to the readers of the article.

### For a comprehensive analysis, I conducted my own examination of the data, providing an overview of the most popular times for visiting the recreation center and delving into the reasons behind their popularity. Additionally, I attempted to predict future times using a Linear Regression model. However, the model's performance was not satisfactory. To improve the accuracy of predictions, I turned to ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average Model), a powerful time forecasting technique that leverages historical data. By considering values from previous times, the ARIMA model provided better predictions for future times.

### This project involved various stages, including data preprocessing, analysis, and predictive modeling, The insights gained from this project shed light on the most popular visitation times and contribute to a better understanding of visitor behavior at the UCSB recreation center.
