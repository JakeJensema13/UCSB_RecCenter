### Outsourced Excel files containing the count of visitors entering the UCSB recreation center per hour. Sorted and filtered the data to be stored in a proper CSV file. Cleaned the data using Pandas to filter data for certain parts of the academic quarter. Created visualizations using MatPlotLib and Canva to display the data in a simple way that readers of the article can understand. Wrote my own analysis of the data for the article which gives a good overview on what the most popular times are for going to the recreation center as well as to why these times are the most popular. Finally ran a Linear Regression model to try and see if we could accuratly predict times in the future. The score of my model was not too good so I used an ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average Model) which helps with time forecasting to give a better prediction based on the values from previous times.
